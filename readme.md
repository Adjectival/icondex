## _a project to navigate data without menus_
### by _Alexander Jacks_

![screenshot](/img/screenshot.png)
### Description
The goal is to have a webapp that looks good on any screen and offers a way to sort through data using only icons. Much dev config needs to happen at this point, yet with time it will approach a "drag in your data" situation and the app will handle most of the icon assignment intelligently.

The demo sorts through fishing opportunities in a video game, based upon place, time of year, and time of day.
